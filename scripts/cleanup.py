"""Operator-run teardown utility (blog "Clean up" section).

This is NOT application runtime code. It is run manually, once, by an operator
to remove leftover schedules and avoid ongoing charges. It must never be wired
into an API handler or a schedule target, because it deletes ALL schedules in a
group.

One-time schedules that already fired are removed automatically by
ActionAfterCompletion: DELETE; this utility mops up the remainder (for example,
recurring schedules, which do not self-delete).

Usage:
    python -m scripts.cleanup task-reminders recurring-tasks
